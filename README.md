# ContactApp
App for Displaying Contact Details

A simple app which reads contact stored on the phone and displays them. The contact details are shown on tapping on any contact. The app uses custom transition (slide in from right to left) for launching the next activity, similar to that seen in Xiaomi phones by default. The user can swipe from right to left to go back, apart from using the back button.
